This is the best hotel stay I've had ever. Stayed in many 5 star hotels but everything with this hotel was perfect. The only thing I would remark on was that our shower smelled a bit bad and I found a tobacco pouch floating up in the shower. But really, it was nothing compared to everything else. Staff was extremely helpful, the cleaners were super nice and did a great job and the desk staff were also amazing. Breakfast was amazing, and the swimmingpool really beautiful. Had such a great stay, didn't want to leave!

City is very nice and would like to visit again. Have many historical monuments. People generally good and helpful. Need to select proper area and hotel for the stay. Some of the areas are very crowded and hotel pictures are very deceptive.

This is my second visit to Delhi this year.



This is my second visit to Delhi this year. It is definitely a great place to come to as a Gateway to India. The traffic is noisy and roads very congested. A useful tip would be to allow plenty of time for road journeys and be very careful when crossing the road.

Only there for 24 hours.



Only there for 24 hours.Neat and clean, the areas I saw.Metro system is easy to use. It is clean and has air conditioning. Travel by metro is highly recommended. Ticket prices start at Rs10, which is equivalent to 10 pence, British currency. Very worthwhile. Gateway and India Parliament buildings are beautiful and light up at night, definitely worthy of a one day trip.This was my first visit to Delhi, despite being an NRI (nin resident Indian). I have visited my home are many times, but Delhi was different and worthy of this visit. I will return to see more of Delhi in the future

Delhi is filled with places to visit. From nightlife to museums, tombs, artefacts and historical gardens, Delhi has them all. It also has a very good metro system that gets you from one point to another for a very low cost.

THE CAPITAL, NEW DELHI.



THE CAPITAL, NEW DELHI. IT IS THE HEART OF THE NATION AND SO DIVERSIFIED & MULTICULTURAL THAT YOU WILL GET ALMOST EVERYTHING THERE. BESIDES THE CHAOS OF THE CITY, IT DOES HAVE IT'S OWN VIBE. SOMEBODY WHO IS FOUND OF EATING, NEW DELHI IS A PARADISE. APART FROM THIS THE HISTORY THAT THIS CITY HAS PRESERVED IN ITSELF IS MARVELLOUS.

New Delhi is a great place in India.



New Delhi is a great place in India. I must have visited more than 7-8 times. For shoppers I would recommend, Lajpat Nagar, Rajiv Chowk( caunaught place), karol baug. chandani chowk. Yummy food, lots of places to historical places to visit.  The best part of Delhi, New Delhi is that it has a wonderful network of Metro which is not only very economical but its a great time saver too.

Delhi budget hotels are not  my favorite. Been travelling India for many years!! So this was nice and efficient for a few nights. Clean and efficient. The desk staff manager was absolutely lovely. 5 stars.... The location was not great for me as too far from Main Bazaar and horrific trafic. First night a dog barked all night (no ones fault!) so they gave me a quieter room at the back which was fine. I was met at the airport by a taxi as I requested to hotel . All and all it was what I expected. Thank you

· I stayed at the Hotel Lotus stay  near airport, and I had a wonderful experience. The hotel is located beside main road. The rooms are spacious and well-appointed, and the staff is friendly and helpful. I especially appreciated the complimentary coffee in the room. The breakfast buffet is also excellent, with a wide variety of Indian and continental options. Overall, I had a great stay and I would definitely recommend it to others

The location of the hotel is amazing, very close to the airport. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Had to wait a bit for checkin but that is expected during corona.The room was spacious and very clean. Loved the number of sockets near the bed, super helpful in charging all my electronics. The food in room service was amazing, some of the best I have ever had in a 4-5 star hotel.Perfect experience, would stay here again.

5 star hotel with 5 star customer service. The buffet food, with so many varieties, is so yummy and top notch quality. All the staff is sweet, friendly and professional and so helpful. The hotel is very close to the Indira Gandhi International Airport. The premises are huge, clean and the ambience is great. It has a mall next door as well (5min walk). I cannot fault it, loved it! Thanks everyone!

Great stay near New Delhi Railway Station. I stayed with my friend and this hotel is really good one especially near to our expected budget including a good Indian breakfast. Hotel has a tour assistant lady and all hotel staff are very helpful. Sure, we will visit again.  we stayed in 4th and 3rd floor rooms. 3rd floor rooms are better. They arranged a sim card for us within 30mins time.

One of the best budget hotels in New Delhi with ample services and amenities. From reception to checkout. The discovery of the roof was spectacular. And especially Chef Kuwar Singh was very good in his business. I will definitely be visiting with family and baby in the near future. good hospitality keep it up
